<h1> Picking A Game And Character
</h1>

<p>Starting with picking a game, it’s challenging because there’s nearly endless options to pick from, and one of them is likely to be the perfect fit. For me, my perfect fit is Super Smash Bros. Melee, a 2001 party fighting game that was never meant to be played competitively, but has everything I love about gaming. That’s because it requires a ton of mechanical skill as well as creativity. It’s fast paced, and truly unique. I think it’s best to try a variety of games and see which genre sticks out the most, MOBAs, first person shooters, fighting games, etc, and then look deeper into specific titles within that genre. </p>

<p>As far as picking a character, this is one of the most important things a player needs to do when playing a competitive game. As cheesy as it sounds, a character really is an extension of yourself. It’s how you express yourself within the game, so you need to pick a character that you really enjoy playing. Just like there’s high variance between games in terms of mechanical ability required, characters are no different. In a game like League of Legends, mechanics aren’t as important as they are in other games. However, some characters within League of Legends require intense mechanics in order to be played efficiently. 
</p>

<p>I love the adrenaline when playing an intense match that goes down to the wire, it’s my favorite feeling in gaming. At the end of the day, if you’re playing a competitive game, it’s probably not a good fit if you don’t get this feeling. You should find a game that really brings out the fun emotions of the experience. Something that you can get passionate about, if that’s what you’re looking for of course. Everyone’s passionate about something, I’m glad that gaming can be that outlet for so many people.
