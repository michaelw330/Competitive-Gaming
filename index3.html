<h1> Improving At A Game</h1>

<p>A lot of players want to go pro in a game, reach a certain rank, or have some other goal in mind, but struggle to achieve it. Just like any other practice, improving at a game is its own skill. People who have reached a high level of play in one game can usually learn other games relatively quickly too. Depending on what your goal is, it usually takes a good mix of playing the game, studying pro and high level players, and rewatching your own gameplay to go in detail about the mistakes you make. I reached the top 0.029% of players in League of Legends, and those are the key factors that gave me success. 

</p>

<p>Watching the recording of games is one of the fastest ways to improve when applied well. When you watch your own gameplay or that of a pro, it’s important to not make assumptions about whether or not something is correct. You should always try to critically think about why something resulted in the way it did. It’s often helpful to watch a video of a pro player when they are in the same situation that you were in your own game. More often than not, they’ll make a relatively good decision and you can apply that to your own gameplay in order to see what was different about your decision making in that similar situation. 

</p>

<p>No matter what, it’s crucial to not be results oriented during your improvement process. Being results oriented means that you judge the quality of a decision or play based on the outcome. Just because something worked, doesn’t mean it was a good decision, and vice versa. Put simply, if choice A works 90% of the time and choice B works 10% of the time, getting away with choice B doesn’t mean it was the correct decision. Getting stuck in result oriented thinking is one of the most common falls of players when they try to improve.
