<h1> Mentality</h1>

<p>Mentality is without a doubt the most important aspect for every player in any game. Whether it’s video games or sports, mentality is what will make or break a player or team. Unfortunately, it’s also the hardest skill to master. Even the best players in the world have mental blocks, let their ego get in their own way, and get upset. This is why any player from any game will tell you that at the highest level of play, the player with the better mentality is the one that typically always wins. 
</p>

<p>Ego in gaming is the number one reason why certain players never get where they want to be, or get upset. A player’s ego protects them from thinking that they are to blame for their own gameplay, and prevents them from thinking clearly. I’ve seen so many players with so much potential fall due to this one simple aspect of mentality. For me, having a specific goal helps me keep my ego in check. When I wanted to reach a high level of play in League of Legends, I went from the top 5% of players to the top 0.029% of players in a matter of months. I had a specific goal that I wanted to achieve, so even when I lost a game, I would think to myself, “that’s okay, all I can do from this position is learn what I can and try to do better next time.”  
</p>

<p>For me, I noticed my quality of play and mentality would suffer if I played for too much at one time. Some people play games for hours on end trying to rank up. I found that I benefited from playing 1-4 games and then taking a long break, sometimes for a day or two. I’d rather play my best and only play when my mentality is good than play as many games as I have time for. It really is as simple as quality over quantity, but what this means varies for each player.
