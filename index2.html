<h1> Mechanical Games Vs. Nonmechanically Based Games</h1>

<p>Some games require an absurd amount of actions per minute (APM) just to be on the same playing field as your opponent. For example, professional Starcraft 2 players often have an APM of 450. Even in mechanical games like these, strategy is still just as important, you need to be thinking as fast as your fingers are moving, which is incredible to watch. I personally love playing mechanical games because it’s so satisfying to be so precise with your movements in a game while also deploying a winning strategy with your thinking. Usually games like these have really flashy moments because when a player displays sheer mechanical ability in a crucial moment, everyone watching knows just how crazy that sequence was. 
</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are games that require quite literally zero mechanics, and everything in between. This doesn't mean these games are easy though. For example, Hearthstone is a card game that never requires a player to use any mechanics. Games like these are only testing a player's ability to outthink their opponent and make superior choices. There aren’t many games with zero mechanics, but there’s plenty that don’t require as absurd levels of APM as a game like Starcraft 2. League of Legends strikes a middle ground of having plenty of opportunities to crush your opponent with mechanics, but it’s typically going to reward you more for having the better strategy.
</p>

<p>This is why fighting games are some of my favorite games to play and watch. They combine everything I love. For the most part, fighting games are very fast paced, require a high degree of mechanical skill, never ending strategy, and they’re a one versus one game. Combining these factors leads to it truly being a battle of you versus your opponent. You don’t have a team to blame or rely on, no physical advantages, etc. These games are often compared to chess, not because they’re particularly similar in the specific strategies used, but because it's a battle of the minds in a one on one showdown.
